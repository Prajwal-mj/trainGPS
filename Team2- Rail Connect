SYSTEM DESIGN
Hardware and software requirements (UI)
Intelligent System
Circuit design
Monitoring devices
Database to store train details (Firebase cloud)
GPS satellite


4)Low-level Design GPS Module
Sensors
(Accelerometer, Obstacle detection)
Switching Machine


5) Unit testing
To check the corresponding output of all the devices(GPS, switching machine, signaling device) which will be used.


6) we are done and looking forward

is it edited

7) System testing
To check if the circuit is working properly or not and if it is able to give the output of which track is vacant.

8) Acceptance
To deploy the project into live environment after analysing all the trial and errors of the software.
To check customer satisfaction


Budget is require to install GPS module (Cost of 1 GPS module is around Rs 5000). So we can calculate the cost required for the GPS tracker is no of trains * Cost of 1 gps module.
Requirements of Sensors in order to interaction of the GPS with the software.
Installation of Software.
Maintenance (gps devices, sensors)
